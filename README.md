# WEDE-PART-2
# Zakwantu Projects & Services Website

## Project Overview
This is the official website for *Zakwantu Projects & Services*, that showcases the company’s services, projects, bursary application, their work, success stories and community initiatives.  

## Features
- I’ve added a fully *responsive design* for desktop, mobile, and tablet.
- *External CSS* has been applied for consistent styling across all the web pages.
- *Navigation menu* linking all major pages but not all of them to avoid the navigation bar being crowded.
- Sections include:
  - Home
  - About Us
  - Our Services
  - Our Work & Success Stories
  - Resources
  - Donations
  - Contact Us
  - Applications

## Part 2 Updates
- I made sure there are *responsive layouts* by using CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries.
- I added previously missing content such as: 
  - Graduate images and profiles
  - Pilot student story (Khazimla)
  - Lab Assistant programme update (Benedict)
  - Vacation work experience (Jonita)
  - Career development programme & dignity packs
  - Fireside conversations
- I also added a *brief summary section* at the start of the “Our Work” page.
- All the edits are documented in the *changelog section* below.
